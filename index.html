        <p class="text-center">
          A wonderful day beautiful human! We are “The Dino-Source”, or as we
          like to call ourselves, the group that procrastinates the most but
          still manages to utter useless words of complain and agitation. This
          group comprises of five members as we are speaking. We are named KC
          Bañas, Charles Moedin, Micah Abella, Hena Micah dela Cruz, and Narciso
          Geroche.
        </p>
        <p class="text-center">
          We would like our group to be remembered as a clan full of crazy and
          free-spirited people. We all have a lot of similarities. We all are
          students going to the same school, belonging in the same section, with
          the same class schedules, with the same teachers, with the same
          subjects that we are taking. You can call us like-minded in the aspect
          that we have simultaneous academic responsibilities that we have to
          fulfill. However, despite the similarities that each of us possess,
          there are some things worth mentioning that are beyond the superficial
          aspect of ourselves.
        </p>
        <p class="text-center">
          A lot of students are known to be hardworking and determined
          individuals. They are even known to carry a lot of weight in regards
          to their academic responsibilities and their personal lives. Given
          this fact, it is a no brainer that we are also experiencing this.
          There are definitely times where we feel drained and unmotivated to do
          our tasks. Sometimes it even gets to the point where we start
          questioning our purpose in life. Because life couldn’t just be about
          studying and complying to homeworks and projects right? It is however
          a relief to know that we have each other to comfort one another
          whenever we feel the world is too tiring to face and life too draining
          to go on.
        </p>
        <p class="text-center">
          What keeps us motivated? As stated above, we do sometimes question the
          meaning of life and our purpose in this world. Our greatest motivation
          of course is our goals and dreams, family, and God. These three
          usually are what keeps us inspired in doing what we are doing now.
          School is not always fun, that’s a known fact. School is not fun
          especially if you are continuously striving to be the best and not get
          the desired result. However, as we grew older, we realized that school
          really is not just all about being the best. In fact, life is not
          about being the best. Life is all about doing what you enjoy with your
          friends and making the most out of it. For this matter, doing
          programming and coding with them which constitutes to a lot of fun
          things to bond with.
        </p>
        <p class="text-center">
          We came to realize that as part of our growth, we are also learning a
          lot of things. For example, this project is not merely a project. This
          is an opportunity for us to showcase our skills in dealing with
          technology. This also an opportunity where we get to learn a lot of
          things when it comes to programming and computers. Maybe, this is also
          an opportunity for one of us discover that programming may be their
          passion. This is very useful because the world is becoming more and
          more modernized as time passes. Sooner or later, any practical
          activities may also be dealt with computers. It’s important to keep up
          with the trends these days and we think this project is perfect for
          it.
